Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

* Insert a character
* Delete a character
* Replace a character

Constraints:
* 0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
* word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

        int n = word1.size(), m = word2.size();

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

            dp[0][j] = j;
