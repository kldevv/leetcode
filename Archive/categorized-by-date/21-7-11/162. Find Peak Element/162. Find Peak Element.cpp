A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
* -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
* nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            int val = nums[mid];

            if (val < nums[mid+1])
                left = mid + 1;
