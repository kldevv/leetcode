Name: 1048. Longest String Chain
Difficulty: Medium
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/
Description: 
  - You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.
  - wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.
  - For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
  - A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.
  - Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.
Constraints:
  - 1 <= words.length <= 1000
  - 1 <= words[i].length <= 16
  - words[i] only consists of lowercase English letters.
