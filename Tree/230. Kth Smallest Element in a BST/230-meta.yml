Name: 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
Difficulty: Medium
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/
Description: 
  - Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.
Constraints:
  - The number of nodes in the tree is n.
  - 1 <= k <= n <= 104
  - 0 <= Node.val <= 104
FollowUp:
  - If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
