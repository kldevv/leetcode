Difficulty: Medium
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/
Description: 
  - You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.
  - Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.
Constraints:
  - 1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104
  - 1 <= time[i] <= 500
